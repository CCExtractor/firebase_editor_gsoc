# Firebase Editor

## Overview
This project aims to develop a versatile mobile application tailored for efficient data management on Firebase databases. Given Firebase's popularity among small to medium-scale projects for its schemaless nature, there is a growing need for a generic mobile editor that enables seamless CRUD operations, independent of the database structure. Our project addresses this need by building a user-friendly and feature-rich mobile application that effectively empowers users to manage Firebase databases.
